# HorseRaceSimulator
A horse racing simulator with a GUI that includes betting system and customisation of the simulator. This porject is made for ECS414U that includes a deep exploration of using Java as an OOP language and expanding its roots to GUI development using Java Swing standard library. This approach is a first-hand experience to creating a fully fledged GUI system that allows for dynamic functions in various areas to deepen my knowledge in this area.
